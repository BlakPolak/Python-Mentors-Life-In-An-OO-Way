    In Tennessee a very rich man who wanted to be even richer created a technology park in which young talented adepts

    You meet a group of uncertain about their humanity androids and you are asked to help to program them in such a way
    so that they felt more human - alike. The price is high - we need more programming teachers and there is less and less
    humans due to plague of laziness created, ironically by technology development ... Once a level of humanity is acquired
    the Mentor Android will be sent to new Codecool School to teach a class of extraordinary programmers.
