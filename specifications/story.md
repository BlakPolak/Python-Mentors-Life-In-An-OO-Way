_In the near future not that far away..._

In Tennessee a very rich man who wanted to be even richer created a technology
park in which young talented adepts are invited to learn how to code.
It's a place in which an experiment is happening. Once entering you are given
are given a quest. You meet a group of uncertain about their humanity androids
and you are asked to help to program them in such a way so that
they felt more human - alike. The price is high - we need more programming
teachers and there is less and less humans  due to plague of
laziness created ironically by technology development...

Once a level of humanity is acquired the Mentor Android is will being sent to new
Codecool School to teach new class of extraordinary programmers.
